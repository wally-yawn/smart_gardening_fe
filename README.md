# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Rancid Tomatillos

## Description
Rancid Tomatillos is a movie information app that allows users to explore popular movies, view detailed information about each movie, and vote for their favorites. The app includes features such as:
- A homepage displaying movie posters and titles.
- A detailed view of each movie, showing genres, an overview, and more.
- A functional search bar for live filtering of movies by title.
- Voting functionality for users to upvote or downvote movies.

The app is built using React and leverages React Router for navigation. It consumes data from a backend API to fetch movie details and updates.
The work on the project was completed over the course of 8 days.

## How to Use
1. Visit the deployed site: [Rancid Tomatillos](https://lustrous-mochi-8ef560.netlify.app/).
2. Browse the homepage to see a selection of movies.
3. Click on a movie poster to view detailed information about the selected movie.
4. Use the voting buttons to upvote or downvote movies.
5. Navigate back to the homepage by clicking the "Home" button in the header.

## Approaches to Building
- **Component-Driven Development**: The app is structured with reusable components like `MoviesContainer`, `MovieDetails`, and `App` to improve manageability and scalability.
- **React Router**: Implemented for seamless navigation between pages, ensuring a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
- **API Integration**: Data is fetched from a backend API, enabling real-time updates and a responsive voting system.
- **Testing**: End-to-end testing with Cypress ensures the app functions correctly and meets user stories.
